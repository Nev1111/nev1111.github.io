## 🕵️ Welcome to PandAudit Detective Agency

We're data detectives who believe every spreadsheet tells a story, every discrepancy hides a clue, and every "impossible" data problem has a Python solution waiting to be discovered.

### 🎯 **What Makes Us Different**

**We Don't Just Teach Code - We Solve Real Problems**

Instead of boring tutorials, we create engaging detective stories featuring **Masha** 🔍 (the pattern-spotting analyst) and **Panda** 🐼 (the wise technical guide). Every mystery comes from actual accounting scenarios we've encountered.

**We Make Learning Stick Through Stories**

When you're troubleshooting real data at 4 PM on a Friday, you'll remember Masha's frustration with manual processes and Panda's clever solutions. Stories create memory hooks that syntax examples can't match.
