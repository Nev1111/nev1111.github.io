## 🕵️ **Live Mystery Demos**

### **Case File #001: The Disappearing Dollars**
*Interactive Rounding Investigation*

Try the actual code from our first mystery and discover how different rounding methods create legitimate discrepancies.

👉 [**Open Investigation**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nev1111/pandaudit-demo/HEAD?filepath=mystery-001-disappearing-dollars.ipynb)

**What you'll investigate:**
- Compare two rounding calculation methods
- See the exact 2-cent difference that stumped Sarah
- Modify the data to create your own scenarios
- Generate validation reports for management

---

### **Case File #002: Legacy Format Decoder**
*Interactive Text Cleaning Challenge*

Help Sarah decode those bizarre legacy negative formats like "5,009-" and "1,200CR".

👉 [**Open Decoder Tool**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nev1111/pandaudit-demo/HEAD?filepath=mystery-002-legacy-decoder.ipynb)

**What you'll decode:**
- Convert various legacy negative formats
- Test your regex patterns on messy data
- Build a reusable cleaning function
- Handle edge cases and validation

---

### **Case File #003: Time Machine Merger**
*Interactive Historical Data Matching*

Experience the power of `merge_asof` with customer address changes over time.

👉 [**Open Time Machine**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nev1111/pandaudit-demo/HEAD?filepath=mystery-003-time-machine.ipynb)

**What you'll discover:**
- Match addresses to specific dates
- Compare different merge strategies
- Handle missing historical data
- Generate point-in-time reports
