## Mission

PandAudit was created to bridge the gap between traditional accounting practices and modern data analytics. Our mission is to provide practical, actionable tutorials that help finance and accounting professionals leverage Python to automate workflows, analyze data more effectively, and advance their careers.

## Why This Matters
