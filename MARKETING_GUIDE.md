##  Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Posting and Ghosting:** Don't just post links and disappear. Engage!
2. **Too Much Self-Promotion:** Provide value FIRST, promote second (10:1 ratio)
3. **Inconsistency:** Missing weeks kills momentum
4. **Ignoring Analytics:** Double down on what works, cut what doesn't
5. **No Clear CTA:** Every piece of content needs a clear next step
6. **Generic Content:** Be specific! "Python for accountants" > "Learn Python"
7. **Not Building Email List:** Social media accounts can disappear. Email is yours.
8. **Giving Up Too Early:** Growth takes 6-12 months. Stay consistent!
